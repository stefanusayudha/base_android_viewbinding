# Welcome to my blog!

Hai, i am Steve and i am an Android developer. I write a base sample code for everyone who wanted to study Android programming. We also offering free course to everyone who wanted to learn Android programming mainly through the community that i run named Yogyakarta Developer Community in Indonesia. This base learning code will help you through your journey learning Android app. Feel free to learn and using it, and to hangout with us in Yogyakarta Developer Community.


# Journey Start

Here is what you will go through.

## Presentation

There is bunch of technology you can choose to build presentation. There is two main thing of building presentation.
1. Build tool
	Such XML layouting or Jetpack Compose for the newest version. There is codebase version using Jetpack Compose as base presentation [here (soon)]() .
2. Theme
	We suggest to use Material Design, as is what we are using in this code base. Its fine, robust, and progressing.

You will learn about how to 
1. Build presentation, 
2. Doing navigation
3. Activity
4. Fragment
5. View Model
6. and the Android Lifecycle.

## Data Operation

Flow data of this code base following "Offline first" but for easy learning i am also including online first data flow. There is two main technology that we will learn in this codebase.

 1. **Retrofit**, a library for network operation. 
 2. **Room database**, for local database operation.

Also you will learn about
1. Flow data using **StateFlow**
2. Data Convertion using **GSON**
